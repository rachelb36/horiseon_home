# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

- BOOTCAMP MODULE 1 CHALLENGE - Assigned after
- Modified starter code to make an existing site more accessible.  Applied scout rule and combined redundant code and removed dead code.
- Learned how to use semantic tag, more css, adding more descriptive alt tags to images.
- Modified <title> to be descriptive for SEO and accessibility
- Added <alt> tag to all images for accessibility

- Take the provided codebase and refactor it to make it accessible. Don't forget the cardinal rule when working with someone else's code: "Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it"
